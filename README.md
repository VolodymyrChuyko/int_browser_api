This stand demonstrates
   - how to create, resolve, and reject a promise
   - the difference in a recursive invocation of promises and setTimeout (callbacks of a promise are treated as microtasks and callbacks of setTimeout are tasks)
   - how to promisify and use promisifyed setTimout
   - how to create and use cancelable promise
